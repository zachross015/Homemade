# Homemade
## Summary
This is mainly a personal project I am working on, but the premise of it is a
recipe book that retrieves data from most of the popular cooking websites and
formats them to XML. It will then be available to be retrieved from a server so that
devices can get the data and format it properly. The use of this is to make
a (hopefully) aesthetically appealing interactable application for saving and
changing recipes.

## To Do
### Tests:

### Get formats for the following sites
* eatthis.com
* rachelraymag.com
* eatingwell.com
* recipe.com

### ingredient.py:
* Write parse Method
  * define parse_unit
  * define parse_name
